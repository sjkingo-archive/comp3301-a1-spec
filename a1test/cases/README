Each file in this directory is a test input that the a1test program can parse.
The files specify the test case that should be run. The format is as follows:

[BEGIN FILE]
lifetime
prio_i greedy_i
prio_i+1 greedy_i+1
...
prio_i+N greedy_i+N
[END FILE]

All inputs should be integers and are parsed as such. The first line of the
file contains one field (with no trailing or leading whitespace) that denotes
the lifetime of the process (in seconds) -- that is, how long the test program
will run for.

Every other line contains details of a thread to spawn. There must be at least
one (so a valid file will always 2 or more lines). These lines contain two
fields (separated by a single space): the first is the priority of the thread
(this will be set via the library call pth_attr_set(PTR_ATTR_PRIO, ...). The
second field is the "greedy factor". This is an integer in the range [0..100],
denoting how "greedy" the thread will be, that is, how long it will spend on
the CPU before yielding.
